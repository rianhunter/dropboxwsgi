dropboxwsgi
============

``dropboxwsgi`` is a Python_ package that provides a WSGI_ application that
implements an HTTP_ interface into the `Dropbox API`_. This package
includes a server application, also called ``dropboxwsgi``, that runs
the WSGI application from the command line.

This is useful in situations where you'd like to serve a web site
out of your Dropbox, either to the world or in a private network.
Compare this to the current solution of linking the Dropbox desktop
client on your server and serving out of your Dropbox folder.

This package also contains a caching middleware that will cache data
from the Dropbox API onto the local disk (or whatever storage
implementation you provide) to eliminate redundant data transfer
between your server and Dropbox.

By the way, this package also supports Python 3. Yay!

Installation
------------

Installation is easy and fun::

  $ python setup.py install

Features
--------

* Supports standard HTTP caching headers (ETag, Last-Modified) and logic
* Optional automatically generated directory listings
* "index.html" file support
* Caching middleware (in ``dropboxwsgi.caching``)
* Supports Python 2.5+, 3+, PyPy
* Automatically uses gevent if available

Server Application Usage
------------------------

``dropboxwsgi`` is both a server application and a library. Let's try
using it on the command line first::

  $ cat <<EOF > config.ini
  [Credentials]
  consumer_key = <your_dropbox_api_key>
  consumer_secret = <your_dropbox_api_secret>
  access_type = app_folder

  [Server]
  http_root = http://localhost:8080
  listen = 8080
  EOF
  $ dropboxwsgi -c config.ini -l info
  Server is running; using wsgiref server

Pretty simple. Now point your browser to ``http://localhost:8080/``. If
you want to run this in production I recommend using the gevent_ WSGI
server and using nginx_ as frontend proxy.

Library Usage
-------------

WSGI applications, like ``dropboxwsgi``, have the benefit of being
able to run in a variety of server environments. `App Engine`_ and
Heroku_ come to mind but running it on your own VPS works too. Let's
try it using the reference WSGI implementation included with Python::

  #!/usr/bin/python

  from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server
  from dropboxwsgi.dropboxwsgi import make_app, MemoryCredStorage
  
  config = dict(http_root="http://localhost:8080",
                consumer_key="<your dropbox api key",
                consumer_secret="<your dropbox api secret>",
                access_type"dropbox or app_folder")

  app = make_app(config, MemoryCredStorage())

  make_server("", 8080, app).serve_forever()

The vanilla WSGI application provides the standard HTTP caching headers
(both ETag and Last-Modified) but otherwise doesn't litter the HTTP
header space. This makes it so you can layer as much middleware as you
want between the application and the server.

Extensibility
-------------

If I haven't stressed it already enough quite yet, let me try once more.
There are dozens of middleware packages available for WSGI and even more
proxy servers that speak HTTP. Extending ``dropboxwsgi`` is simply a
matter of hooking things together. Do you want a caching Dropbox-backed
server with HTTP auth? Squid_ + nginx + ``dropboxwsgi`` solves your
problem. The possibilities are endless!
